# SP1
My Semester Project for school at noroff.

# Description
This project is a website i have created for a assignment for school.
The website is a Science Museum homepage that is suppose to draw in children of all ages to come visit the museum.
There are lots of information and cool pictures on the site for all ages, and ive created it to look abit clean so the colors from pictures etc pops out to the user.
The site should also be very easy to navigate and the layout is made so it is easy to find the information the user is looking for.
